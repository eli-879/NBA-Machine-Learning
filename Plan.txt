Want to get data to predict outcome of a NBA regular season game

Have each seasons detail and brief stats - must combine them into 1 huge dataset

What things to use to predict a win/loss?

[date, team, rank, gamesW, gamesL, gamesB, ptsFor, ptsAgainst, homeW, awayW, last5, last10, ptsScoreAvg, ptsAllowAvg, daysOff, teamPts]

y_data - [1 for home win or 0 for away win]


#Gather dataset into home/away for each game for each team
"""
array = basic_data.values
game_scores = array[:, 2:6]
num_home_wins = 0

for game in game_scores:
    if game[1] > game[3]:
        num_home_wins += 1

home_win_percentage = num_home_wins / len(game_scores) * 100

print(home_win_percentage)
